Game agnostic MCTS
Inspired by github : https://github.com/sergeim19/SinglePlayerMCTS
In this file, we implemented the MCTS process that solves a single player
game without having any domain knowledge. The main methods we had to implement were
the selection, expansion, simulation and backpropagation, using helper methods to do so.
The evaluation method we chose to evaluate the nodes was the Upper Confidence Bound (UCT).
The actual final result of the terminal state nodes comes from the game implementation
