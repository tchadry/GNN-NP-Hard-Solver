# NP-Hard problems solver with no domain knowledge using Graph Neural Networks and Monte Carlo Tree Search

The approach includes reducing the problems into a MDP structure, and so we expect to be able to solve any problem which can be represented in such form. We also want to explore forms of representing the graph structure, trying to use GNNs. Finally, for the optimization routine, we will use Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Our method is to re adapt the algorithm to as many NP hard problems as possible, try different optimization routines and ultimately create a generalized unified algorithm that can solve distinct NP-Hard problems efficiently with minimal adjustments.
